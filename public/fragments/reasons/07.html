<h2>I've got the skills</h2>

<p>Throughout my career I have spent the time mastering the fundamentals of the web - <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Armed with this knowledge, I am quick to learn new libraries and frameworks, having worked with jQuery, Backbone, Angular, Vue and React. Last year I joined a Rails project and introduced Stimulus to the front-end, learning Ruby along the way.</p>

<p>I've been trusted to architect large-scale web and mobile apps from the ground up. I understand the importance of code quality, valuing the presence of linters, well-written tests and thoughtful code reviews.</p>

<p>As JavaScript has evolved, I've made sure to keep up. More recently, I've invested heavily in <strong>TypeScript</strong>. Although I began as a skeptic, nowadays I would be hesitant to start a JavaScript-based project without it. I'm a fully-fledged convert, so much so that I recently authored and held a <a href="https://github.com/studiozeffa/typescript-training-course" target="_blank">TypeScript workshop</a> for a local company.</p>
