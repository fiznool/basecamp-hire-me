<h2>Our ideas for the web are aligned</h2>

<p>For a while I've been wondering if the web is moving too far from its roots. The proliferation of everything-in-JS (see: JSX, CSS-in-JS) provides a pleasing development experience, but at the expense of higher complexity and larger bundle sizes. I believe Stimulus is just the tonic: a front-end library true to the idea of progressive enhancement, built with modern tooling in mind.</p>

<p>After using Stimulus in production for a few months on a recent project, I am convinced by its mandate - the antidote to bloated frameworks. I'd be delighted to be given the opportunity to progress Stimulus and friends, using some of my real-world experience to feed into the evolution of the library.</p>
