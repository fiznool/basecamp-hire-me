<h2>I am passionate about my job</h2>

<p>I've been programming professionally since 2006, when a successful business magnate <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/business-news/hothouse-training-puts-start-up-track-1935838" target="_blank">offered me the chance to set up a company with 4 other recent graduates</a>. Since then I've been honing my craft as a front-end web developer, working my way up through hard work, persistence and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Today, I am no different - I'm still as passionate as ever about my career. I <a href="https://www.fiznool.com/blog" target="_blank">write</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNSh6FZRFE" target="_blank">speak</a> and <a href="https://developme.training/fellowship/" target="_blank">teach</a> about the things that I have learned, in an effort to share my knowledge with the next generation of developers.</p>
