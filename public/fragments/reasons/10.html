<h2>I ðŸ’– open source</h2>

<p>Open source is the foundation of modern web development. I wouldn't be here today without the many contributions of developers from all over the world.</p>

<p>I try to give back to this movement wherever I can. Over the years I've <a href="https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Afiznool+archived%3Afalse+is%3Apublic+is%3Aclosed" target="_blank">made contributions</a> to React Native, React Navigation, Moment.js, Heroku, Ionic, Passport.js, SinonJS, DefinitelyTyped and others.</p>

<p>I've also authored a number of open source modules that are in use by others:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser-xml" target="_blank">body-parser-xml</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-oauth2-refresh" target="_blank">passport-oauth2-refresh</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-mongo-sanitize" target="_blank">express-mongo-sanitize</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm passionate to continue contributing to the open source community, whether as part of my job or in my spare time.</p>
