<h2>I'm a generalist, but a front-ender at heart</h2>

<p>I've got bags of experience working for small companies and clients, and so I appreciate the need to wear many hats, both technical and non-technical. I understand the importance of so-called 'soft' skills, and strive to respect my colleagues with non-intrusive communication, empathetic reasoning and calm thinking. I can speak in front of an audience, and have often been placed in client-facing positions in previous jobs.</p>

<p>On a technical level, I consider myself a front end web developer, but I've also had significant experience building out back-ends (primarily using node.js), and I'm adept at wireframing and making fundamental UX decisions. This deeper understanding of the <em>full stack</em> has a profound impact on the way that I write front-end code.</p>
