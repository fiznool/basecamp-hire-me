<h2>I understand remote work</h2>

<p>I've been working remotely on a full time basis since 2014. Here's what I've learnt during this time. </p>

<ul>
  <li>I always try to communicate asynchronously. Whilst it's important to interrupt someone in an emergency, this is a rare event, and can be destructive to a developer's focus.</li>
  <li>I take time to create <strong>thoughtful messages</strong> that do not criticise or antagonise. I try to avoid the use of emotive words and phrases such as <em>you</em> or <em>can't you just</em>.</li>
  <li>I appreciate that whilst I can often work anywhere or any time, it's important to be <strong>available during 'office hours</strong>' should somebody need to contact me.</li>
  <li>I've created a <strong>home office</strong> where I can separate work from life. It is a quiet space where I can fully concentrate on so-called 'deep' work.</li>
  <li>I make sure my broadband connection is <strong>fast and stable</strong>. Time spent waiting for files to download or diagnosing video calling issues is better spent elsewhere. </li>
  <li>I <strong>switch off</strong> at the end of the day. I have learned that the best work cannot be carried out when stressed and overworked.</li>
</ul>
