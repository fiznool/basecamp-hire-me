<h2>I have a proven track-record</h2>

<p>In my 14 years career as a professional web developer, I've:</p>

<ul>
  <li>developed web and mobile applications for two award-winning local agencies</li>
  <li>founded a profitable consultancy and a start-up company</li>
  <li>built a <a href="https://flowxo.com" target="_blank">SaaS application</a> from the ground up, leading to a sale</li>
  <li>created a set of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/polesaver/id1420447165" target="_blank">native mobile applications</a> for a multi-national manufacturing company</li>
  <li>consulted for a number of different clients, including those based in healthcare, construction, aviation and food industries</li>
  <li>taught over 60 students in a local coding 'bootcamp'</li>
</ul>

<p>Through this time I've continued to expand both my technical and non-technical skills, understanding that the latter (good communication, presentation skills, solid time-keeping) are just as important as the former. I've learned to embrace new challenges and persevere through harder times, but also learned when to call it a day. Feedback from both clients and employers has been <a href="https://www.fiznool.com/about/#testimonials" target="_blank">overwhelmingly positive</a>.</p>
