<h2>I'm well rounded</h2>

<p>In our industry, it's all too easy to become a workaholic. I was guilty of this earlier in my career, and came close to burning out.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I find it important to mentally switch off from work, so I can devote my attention to the other important things in my life - my wife and kids, my friends and family, and my house renovations. When I get some time to myself (an increasing rarity when small children are involved!), I enjoy keeping active by playing sport (football and cricket are my favourites).</p>
