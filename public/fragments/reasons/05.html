<h2>I stay current</h2>

<p>In the fast-changing pace of the front-end, I believe it's important to keep abreast of new developments, without getting too bogged down in the details. My tactics for keeping up to date include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>subscribing to email newsletters: JavaScript Weekly, Web Design Weekly, Front End Weekly and Hacker Newsletter</li>
  <li>listening to podcasts: Syntax, ShopTalk Show, JavaScript Jabber and (of course) Rework</li>
  <li>attending local meetups and conferences</li>
</ul>

<p>I prefer to read articles and listen to podcasts that describe the 'what' and the 'why', rather than the 'how'. Later, if I work on a project that would benefit from this new information, I will 'deep dive' and learn it in more depth. I find this approach strikes a good balance between keeping up to date and becoming overwhelmed.</p>
