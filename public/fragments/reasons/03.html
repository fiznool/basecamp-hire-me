<h2>I won't let you down</h2>

<p>Since becoming a full-time consultant in 2014, I have enjoyed working remotely on a wide range of interesting projects. The freedom to research and use new technologies is not something I expected to find in a permanent job. Then, I came across your job post in JavaScript Weekly, and it became clear: this is the job I've been waiting for.</p>

<p>I've been following Basecamp since I first became aware of your product in 2009. In a sea of Silicon Valley noise, Basecamp's voice is refreshing and alternative, and aligns well with my own values: honesty, enterprise and above all a healthy work/life balance.</p>

<p>The opportunity to work for Basecamp is not something that comes up every day - it would be the highlight of my career to work for you, and I would not let you down.
